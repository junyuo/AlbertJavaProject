/**
 * Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most
 * common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is
 * used to refer to a child class object.
 *
 * Writing an interface is similar to writing a class. But a class describes the
 * attributes and behaviors of an object. And an interface contains behaviors
 * that a class implements.
